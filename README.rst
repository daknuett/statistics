Statistic
*********

This is my private statistic library. Includes the following tools:

- Jackknife (co-)variance estimator (with performance boosted versions for
  functions of means)
- Levenberg-Marquardt fitter with error propagation and jackknife error
  estimation.
- Estimation of integrated autocorrelation time.
- Formatter of values with statistical error using two significant digits on
  the error.
